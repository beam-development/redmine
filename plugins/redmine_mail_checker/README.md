### A Redmine plugin to check your mails, easy ;)

This plugin replaces Redmine rake task to check mails.

## Why?

Running periodicaly ```bundle exec rake redmine:email:receive_imap``` to check your mails leads to high memory consumption : Redmine is loaded twice, once for your webserver and once for the cron task.
This is not very efficient : for VPS with small memory size this can lead to memory saturation and the intervention of the OOM Killer who will kill the job.

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with Redmine versions > **2.4.x**.

## Installation

**1)** Install this plugin with git clone

```sh
redmine$ cd REDMINE_ROOT/plugins
redmine$ git clone https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_mail_checker.git
redmine$ cd redmine_mail_checker/
redmine$ git checkout 1.0.0
```

*No need of db:migrate or bundle update, just restart Redmine.*

**2)** Enable WS for mail reception (in *Administration -> Settings -> Incoming emails*) and generate an API key.

**3)** Configure your mailbox settings (in *Administration -> Plugins -> Configure*)

**4)** Then configure your crontab to call a specific url to trigger mailbox check instead of ```bundle exec rake redmine:email:receive_imap```

```sh
curl http://redmine.example.net/check_mails?key=<API_KEY>
```

That's all!
